# Global-Coffee-Insights-Power-BI
### Project Overview  
Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard using **International Coffee Organization (ICO)** datasets to explore global coffee production, consumption, and pricing trends. The project visualizes how coffee flows from producers to consumers across regions while analyzing price disparities, market dynamics, and farmer equity.

### Dashboard Sections  

1. **World Coffee Map** – Highlights top producing and consuming countries, showing global distribution of coffee production.  
2. **Top Producers & Consumers** – Ranks leading coffee-producing and consuming nations, comparing regional dominance and market share.  
3. **Global Consumption Trends** – Tracks worldwide consumption growth from 2008–2018, showing rising demand over time.  
4. **Production vs Consumption** – Compares total global coffee production and consumption to identify balance and supply gaps.  
5. **Arabica vs Robusta vs Composite Prices** – Analyzes price variations between major coffee types and their impact on the global market.  
6. **ICO vs Grower Prices** – Examines price disparities between international market prices and those received by farmers, calculating **Farmer Share %** as a measure of trade equity.

### Tools & Techniques  
- **Power BI** (DAX, Power Query, Data Modelling, Custom Visual Formatting)  
- Data Transformation: Unit conversion to *million kilograms* for clear comparative analysis  
- Custom DAX Measures: *Farmer Share %, Avg Composite Price, Surplus/Deficit Calculation*  
- Dashboard Design: Coffee-themed UI/UX with consistent typography, color palette, and storytelling captions

### Key Insights  
- Brazil leads both production and consumption globally, emphasizing its dual role in the coffee supply chain.  
- Worldwide coffee consumption increased by over **30% between 2008 and 2018**.  
- **Arabica** beans consistently maintain higher prices than **Robusta**, reflecting their premium quality.  
- Farmers receive approximately **75–80%** of global composite prices — a sign of improved, but still uneven, trade equity.  
- Visual storytelling design communicates data insights through an aesthetic, thematic dashboard.
